# Image Gallery
Since my coding learning is too slow (I took too much everything), I arranged a personal coding marathon for a whole week. The main goal - do one project per day from 28.06.2023 to 04.07.2023.
<br />
This is my sixth project in this marathon - Image Gallery. To create it, I used React and Unsplash API.
<br />
### Technology & Resources Used:
1. React, HTML5, and CSS3
2. <a href="https://unsplash.com/developers">Unsplash API</a>
